Exercise5 Version 1.0 


INTRODUCTION
------------

The CodeInput.ipynb program allows the user to make 3 inputs; their name, their favorite food, and how much they make at an hourly rate, and then prints an output utilizing all three inputs to recommend the user to buy their favorite food using the money they make from their income. The program was created to aid people, particularly workers, in making sound decisions by encouraging them to use the money they earn from their job to buy their favorite food.

BUGS & FIXES
------------

Obviously, this program is not very complicated in what it does. Some possibilities for bugs users have reported in the past include the program not functioning in the circumstance of the user inputting an invalid input. However, this was fixed recently with the use of the *try/except* function. As of 10/26/21, there is no other history regarding bugs & fixes within the code.
